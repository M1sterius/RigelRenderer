Rendering pipeline:
	1) Generate depth maps
	2) Geometry pass
	3) Lighting pass
	4) Forward rendering


RenderableMesh:
	1) Uses pre-defined material with built-in shaders
	2) Goes through deferred rendering pipeline
	3) Included in depth map generation
	4) Does not support custom material creation
	5) Affected by lighting

CustomRenderable:
	1) Can use custom materials with custom shaders
	2) Does not go through deferred rendering pipeline
	3) Always rendered forward way after deferred rendering
	4) Is not included into depth map creation
	5) Is not affected by lighting
