Rendering pipeline:
	1) Generate depth maps
	2) Geometry pass
	3) Lighting pass
	4) Forward rendering


RenderableMesh:
	1) Uses pre-defined material with built-in shaders
	2) Goes through deferred rendering pipeline
	3) Included in depth map generation
	4) Does not support custom material creation
	5) Affected by lighting

CustomRenderable:
	1) Can use custom materials with custom shaders
	2) Does not go through deferred rendering pipeline
	3) Always rendered forward way after deferred rendering
	4) Is not included into depth map creation
	5) Is not affected by lighting

Shadow atlases generation:
    1) Specify the desired size of a shadow map for directional light (1024x1024)
    2) Generate an atlas that can accommodate desired amount of shadow maps (4096x4096 for 16 maps)

    1) Iterate over all lights on the scene
    2) Check if light is a directional light
    3) Keep count of lights that has already been generated maps for
    4) Based on the count of lights determine the position in the atlas where the next map should be generated (using % and //)
    5) Set the viewport so that the next map is generated at the appropriate position inside the atlas
    6) Render the scene to the part of the atlas
    7) Move on to the next directional light
